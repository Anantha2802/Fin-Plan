The Financial Time Machine represents a pioneering approach to personal finance management, developed as part of a hackathon initiative. This application introduces innovative features, including AI-driven "what if" scenario analysis for career changes, investments, and major purchases, alongside behavior-based analytics tailored to individual spending patterns. The integration of a privacy-first design, which ensures user data is never shared with financial institutions, and a backward analysis feature to assess the impact of past decisions, further underscores its originality. These advancements aim to make financial planning more accessible, actionable, and personalized.

The potential impact of this app is significant, empowering users with data-driven insights to optimize their financial futures while maintaining data privacy. By bridging the gap between abstract financial planning and concrete decision-making, it has the potential to enhance financial literacy and decision-making on a broad scale.

This project is a collaborative effort by my teammates Anantha Shayan, Pirangi Sukanya, and Kuldeep Kumar, undertaken with the primary motive of participating in and contributing to the hackathon, showcasing our commitment to innovative problem-solving in the tech community.
